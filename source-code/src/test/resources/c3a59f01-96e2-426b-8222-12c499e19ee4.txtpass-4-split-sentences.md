[## talk about their needs, the typical client's face after reading yet another proposal starting with, "hi, my name is ____ and i ____"., talking about their needs and their job posting before talking about yourself is also powerful because it immediately shows them you read their job posting., most freelancers just cut and paste the same garbage proposal to every client, and clients delete it immediately., so the sooner you can show this proposal is really for them, and not a generic cut & paste message that's going to bore them half to death, the better.]
